<h4>Description: </h4>
In this assignment, you will build the lexical analysis module for the
<tt>E--</tt> language, a simple event-processing language. You will use <tt>Flex</tt>, a scanner-generator tool,
for this purpose. The <a href="#SECTION1">lexical structure of <tt>E--</tt></a>
 is defined first,
followed by a description of
the <a href="#SECTION2">interface to the parser</a> (tokens and attributes).

<h4><a name="SECTION1"> Lexical Structure</a></h4>

We first describe the lexical structure of the <tt>E--</tt> language.
<tt>E--</tt> is a rule-based language, i.e., it consists of rules of the
form <it> pat --&gt; action </it>, where <it>pat</it> is a pattern on events,
and <it>action</it> represents the action to be taken when <it>pat</it> is
matched. The <it>action</it> contains calls to external functions that
are implemented outside of E--. In this sense, E-- is a "glue" language,
i.e., it does not provide the features of a full programming language.

<p> The pattern component is a regular expression over events. An event is
characterized by a name and zero or more arguments. These arguments may
take different types, e.g., <tt>int</tt>, <tt>double</tt>, <tt>string</tt>
and so on. The language is <em>case-sensitive</em>; for example,
<tt>for</tt> and <tt>For</tt> are treated as distinct lexical entities.

</p><h5><a name="SECTION11"> Comments, Macros, and Includes</a></h5>
We will use the C-preprocessor <tt>cpp</tt> to preprocess the
source files. This allows us to take advantage of some of the
features provided by cpp, such as the ability to define macros,
the ability to include files, the ability to use
#ifdef's, and to remove comments.

<p>
The driver program will automatically invoke cpp, so you don't have
to worry about it. You should, however, look at the code to see how
to create a simple pipeline in UNIX, passing some input through a
command, and using the output of the command as the input to your
program.

</p><p> The second thing you need to worry about is keeping track of the
current line and current file. This is an issue because of the presence
of macros and includes. To ensure that you can still keep track of current
line and current file, cpp outputs this information whenever it switches
from one file to another, or deletes some input lines (such as those
defining macros). These informational lines are of the form <tt># line
"file" ...</tt>, i.e., they begin with a '#' symbol, then contain line number
information, followed by file name information. (Filename is enclosed
within double quotes.) You can ignore any information following the
filename until the end of that line. Your code needs to parse this
information so that it can always keep track of the current line number
and file name correctly in variables called <tt>yylinenum</tt> and
<tt>yyfilename</tt>.

</p><h5><a name="SECTION12"> Reserved words</a></h5>

The following are reserved words.
<p>
</p><pre>any        bit        bool     byte      class     double
else       enum       event    false     if        import    
int        interface  print    return    string    true 
void
</pre>

<p> This means that the above words cannot be used as the
name of any variable.

</p><h5><a name="SECTION13"> Constants</a></h5>

There are three types of constants supported by <tt>E--</tt>:
integer, floating point and  string constants. 
Integer constants can use decimal notation or hexadecimal
notation. In the latter case, the number should begin
with a <tt>0x</tt>.
<p>
Floating point constants contain a decimal point
(<em>e.g.</em>, <tt>3.14159</tt>) with an optional integer exponent part
(<em>e.g.</em>, <tt>6.022E23</tt>). The character "<tt>e</tt>" that separates the
mantissa and exponent parts may be in upper or lower case.
In either notation, the decimal point must either be preceded or be
succeeded by at least one digit. For a positive exponent, an optional
'+' sign may be present. Thus 1.5, .5, 1.2, 1.e05, .5E+02, 1.77e-02 are
all valid floats, but .e05 is not.

</p><p>
String constants begin and end with a double quote (<tt>"</tt>).
and may contain any sequence of characters.
As in C, if the string
itself contains a double quote, it is "escaped" with a
backslash (<code>\</code>) as in the example string:
 <code>"\"What?\" she exclaimed."</code>. 
Similarly, if the string contains a backslash,
that is escaped too (<em>e.g.</em>, as in <code>"\\"</code>).
The sequences '\t' and '\n' or '\r' denote the tab and newline characters respectively.
Finally, arbitrary binary characters could be encoded within the
string using hex values, e.g., <tt>\x10</tt> denotes the character
with ASCII code 16 (i.e., 0x10 in hex).

</p><p>String constants cannot have embedded lines. Your lexical analyzer
should assume that every string ends with the first newline character
or closing double-quote, whichever appears first.

</p><h5><a name="SECTION14"> Identifiers</a></h5>

Letters denote the upper and lower case
elements of the English alphabet (<tt>a</tt> thru <tt>z</tt> and 
<tt>A</tt> thru <tt>Z</tt>).
<p>
An identifier is a sequence of letters, digits and underscore (<tt>_</tt>),
starting with a letter or underscore(_), and is not one of the reserved words. It cannot
start with a number.

</p><h5><a name="SECTION15"> Operators</a></h5>

The operators of <tt>E--</tt> are:
<p>
</p><pre>:    ,    .    ;    [    ]    (    )    {    } 
+    -    *    /    =    &amp;&amp;   ||   !    -&gt;   ? 
&gt;    &lt;    ==   !=   &gt;=   &lt;=   %   \/	 &amp;   |
~    ^    &gt;&gt;  &lt;&lt;             
</pre>

<h4><a name="SECTION2"> Parser/Driver Interface</a></h4>

<h5><a name="SECTION21"> Tokens</a></h5>

The tokens emitted for each of the above lexical entities are:
<pre>TOK_ARROW     TOK_QMARK    TOK_PAT_OR    TOK_BITAND    TOK_BITOR     TOK_BITNOT
TOK_INTERFACE TOK_BOOL     TOK_CLASS     TOK_ELSE      TOK_FALSE     TOK_IF
TOK_RETURN    TOK_TRUE     TOK_VOID      TOK_INT       TOK_STRING    TOK_BYTE 
TOK_COLON     TOK_COMMA    TOK_DOT       TOK_SEMICOLON TOK_LBRACK    TOK_RBRACK
TOK_LPAREN    TOK_RPAREN   TOK_LBRACE    TOK_RBRACE    TOK_PLUS      TOK_MINUS  
TOK_MULT      TOK_DIV      TOK_ASSIGN    TOK_AND       TOK_OR 	     TOK_NOT
TOK_GT        TOK_LT       TOK_EQ        TOK_NE	       TOK_GE        TOK_LE 
TOK_MOD	      TOK_BITXOR   TOK_SHL       TOK_SHR       TOK_ENUM      TOK_BIT  
TOK_DOUBLE    TOK_PRINT	   TOK_EVENT     TOK_ANY       TOK_USE       TOK_STRCONST
TOK_ID        TOK_UINTNUM  TOK_DOUBLENUM
</pre>
The C constants (<code>#define</code>'s) for these tokens are defined
in the file <tt>E--_lexer.tab.h</tt>.
<p>
Comments and whitespace are stripped by the lexical analyzer,
<em>i.e.</em>, no tokens are
emitted.
</p><p>
The token names are self-explanatory. If you have any questions
about this, please post them to the <b>course discussion board</b>.

</p><h5><a name="SECTION22"> Attributes</a></h5>

Some of the tokens produced by the lexical analyzer have 
additional attributes. For instance, the token 
<tt>TOK_UINTNUM</tt> has the actual value of the integer
constant as an attribute. Since C++ permits only single
return values, the lexical analyzer directly returns only the token.
The attribute of a token is "returned" using a
global variable <tt>yylval</tt>. Since different tokens have
different types of attributes, the type of <tt>yylval</tt>
is defined to be a union <tt>YYSTYPE</tt>, which is defined as follows:

<pre>typedef union {
   char* cVal;
   int   uVal;
   float dVal;
} YYSTYPE;
</pre>

The above definition is also a part of the file <tt>E--_lexer.tab.h</tt>.
<p>
When integer, floating point or string constants are found in
the input program, in addition to emitting the corresponding
tokens, the lexical analyzer must set <tt>yylval</tt> to the
value of the constant. String constants need
non-trivial processing.  First, the starting and terminating
quotes must not stored in the internal representation of the
string. Secondly, the string must be  terminated with the null character
(<code>\0</code>). Thirdly, when escape sequences are used
(<em>i.e.</em>, <code>\\ </code> and <code>\"</code>),
the escape character itself (<em>i.e.</em>, the first backslash) 
must not stored in
in the internal representation. For example, the string 
 <code>"\"What?\" she exclaimed."</code> must be stored internally
as <code>"What?" she exclaimed.\0</code>.
</p><p>
When an identifier is found in the input program,
the token <tt>TOK_ID</tt> must be returned; in addition, the identifier
must be stored in the <tt>cVal</tt> field of <tt>yylval</tt>.

</p><p>
It is the responsibility of the lexical analyzer to keep track
of the current position in the input file, for purposes of generating
diagnostic messages. This is done by updating the global variable
<tt>yylinenum</tt> as newline characters are processed by the lexical analyzer.

</p><p> Note that whitespaces (a sequence of space, newline or tab characters)
serve only to separate tokens. Whitespace itself is not a token and
should never be returned as such. However, note that white space within
string constants is significant and must be handled correctly.
</p><hr>

<h4><a name="path"> Project Path</a></h4>

You will be writing the specifications for the lexical analyzer in a file.
Conventionally, lexical specifications are stored in files with a
<tt>.l++</tt> suffix. <p> Let the specifications be in a file
<tt>E--_lexer.l++</tt>. Use the lexical-analyzer generator
<tt><strong>flex</strong></tt> to create the analyzer from the
specifications. The generated analyzer is a <tt>C++</tt> program, stored
in a file called <tt>E--_lexer.C</tt>. </p><p> Compile
<tt>E--_lexer.C</tt> to get <tt>E--_lexer.o</tt>, link it with
<tt>drivLex.o</tt> to produce an executable, called <tt>demo</tt>. </p><p>

To get started, copy the <tt>Makefile</tt>, sample <tt>E--_lexer.l++</tt>,
the header file <tt>E--_lexer.tab.h</tt> and the driver object file
<tt>drivLex.o</tt> to your working directory. This initial set of files are
set up so that you can run the make file to produce the executable
<tt>demo</tt>. Before you start, try making it and ensure that you get a
program that can successfully run. It will not do any thing, since the lex
specification is basically empty, and the generated scanner will just "eat
up" the input file and do nothing. Starting from this almost-empty but
valid specification file, start adding new rules that will process the
input files as specified above. It is a good idea to start small. The
toughest part of the assignment includes processing strings, floating point
numbers, etc. Recognizing
keywords is quite easy, and can be left for the end. </p><p>

It is useful to begin with rules that have empty action. For example,
</p><pre>          a(a|b)*	{}
</pre>
First step would be to check if you can specify integers without problem.
Run <tt>flex</tt> (actually, use "make demo")
to figure out what the syntax of regular expressions should be.
Write specifications for recognizing identifiers, 
floating point numbers, strings, etc., adding rules one at a time. 
Keep  running <tt>flex</tt> each time you add a new rule
to ensure that there are no problems with the specifications.
Once all the non-trivial rules go through <tt>flex</tt> without a problem,
add the rules for keywords, operators, whitespace etc.

<p>
Once you can get all the rules through <tt>flex</tt>, the next step would
be to add actions to emit tokens. Finally, test the compiled executable
by running the demo program with a test file redirected as input
(e.g., using the command <tt> ./demo tests/in10</tt>). <em>
Do not try typing the keywords interactively.</em> The lex specification
file contains a directive that makes flex generate a non-interactive
scanner, which will work best with input redirected.
</p><p>
Now you are ready to add the more complex actions that set the
appropriate fields of <tt>yylval</tt> for those tokens that are associated
with non-trivial lexemes, and test the whole thing on the 
input files.

<h4><a name="copying"> Available Material</a></h4>

<ul>
<li> The parser/driver interface file <tt>E--_lexer.tab.h</tt> defines
the structures necessary to interface the lexical analysis module with
the driver. When you build the parser in the next assignment, you will
use a similar (if not the same) interface file to integrate the
lexical analyzer and the parser.

</li><li> A valid-but-almost-empty-skeleton lexical specification
<tt>E--_lexer.l++</tt>. Start working from this sample file.

</li><li> A <tt>Makefile</tt> that contains the commands for compiling the
material that is provided to you. Assignment requires one of GNU C++ compiler (g++) or
LLVM's Clang C++ compiler (clang++). According to what is available on your
system, you would need to update CC=.. line from Makefile. By default, Makefile
uses g++ compiler. Other than this, I do not expect that you will need
to make changes to this file, but do make sure that you understand it,
just in case you need to make some changes.
		  
</li><li> The driver program is <tt>drivLex.C</tt>.

</li><li> Sample input files <tt>in*</tt> and the respective driver output
files <tt>out*</tt> are in <tt>tests</tt> directory. Note that out* does not include stderr.
Also, expected output for some test inputs is not provided.

</li></ul>


<hr>

<h4><a name="deliverables"> Deliverables</a></h4>

The lexical analyzer handin must contain:
<ul>
<li>  the source code for the analyzer  (<tt>Flex</tt> specifications), and
	the relevant header files

</li><li> a Makefile that builds the module and links it with the provided driver.

	The Makefile must create an executable called "<tt>demo</tt>".

</li><li>  Any other  files that  are necessary to successfully recompile
      your program. 

      Please read carefully the submission requirements below.
</li></ul>

<hr>

<h4><a name="submission"> Submission Requirements</a></h4>

<em>
Please note the following submission requirements. These are not
simply conventions, but are <b>requirements</b>. They make grading of
the projects easier, and lets us spend more time wading through the
code to award partial credit! They are not difficult to follow, so
failure to do so will result in severe penalties (project may not be
graded!).  If you have trouble with the set-up, post your problem to
the <b>course discussion board</b>.  </em>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>	You must not modify the header files (<tt>E--_lexer.tab.h</tt>). 
	The driver depends on their structure, and modifying them may
	cause the lexical analyzer-driver interface to fail.

</li><li>    The Makefile must be such that it can successfully recompile your
	program with only the files you submit. 

</li><li>	Here is a suggestion for making sure that you submit all
	the necessary files and that 'make' will work.
<pre>	$ mkdir &lt;STUDENT_ID&gt;
	$ ...copy all the files to be submitted into &lt;STUDENT_ID&gt; ...
	$ cd &lt;STUDENT_ID&gt;
	$ make        # check that all goes well; if so, proceed
	$ make clean  # remove unnecessary .o files
        $ ...create a gzipped tar archive of &lt;STUDENT_ID&gt; (i.e., 123456789.tgz)... 

</pre>

</li><li>	If your submission is in multiple directories, there MUST be
	a Makefile at the top level, and it must generate the
	executable <tt>demo</tt> also at the top level.

</li><li>	Please note: The Makefile MUST SUCCESSFULLY MAKE <tt>demo</tt>
	WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY ADDITIONAL FILES. OTHERWISE,
	YOUR PROJECT MAY NOT BE GRADED!
</li></ul>
